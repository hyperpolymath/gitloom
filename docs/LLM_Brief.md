Jonathan has 50+ repos in various states of chaos
He wants to declare: "All my repos should look like THIS"
GitLoom should: Make it so (locally AND remotely)
When Jonathan inevitably messes it up again: GitLoom fixes it -- absolutely. this would have been very helpful. As to the 1000 contributors, I was thinking it was making a generic statemnet like, hey this is scalable,. then I was asked to print the audit directory and was like, omg, what is happening here. And yes, please do that !
